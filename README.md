This repo contains Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis using Jupyter Notebook and Python.

This is my first project which involves significant Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). I obtained the dataset from an online Udemy course. The initial intention of the course's instructor for this dataset was being a teaching tool for discussing about data types. In addition, the instructor used excel during this specific section of the course. Therefore, what is presenting in this project represents almost entirely my own analysis and thoughts.

The project includes 3 files:
1) The main Jupyter Notebook file.
2) The original, untouched Excel data file. 
3) The exported Excel data file after performing data cleaning. This third data file is ideal for potential future use, such as applying Machine Learning techniques or further EDA.

What have I gained from this project?
1) Opportunity to showcase some skills and a genuine way of personal thinking about the dataset.
2) Solidified why EDA is so useful. To be more specific, there wasn't additional context about the data set. I started almost from scratch. During the analysis, I made some significant mistakes. EDA helped me identify patterns that seemed illogical, meaning that I had misinterpreted the context of certain columns. For example, "Age at time of purchase" does not refer to buyer's age, rather than the building's age. EDA revealed this error.
3) Solidified the vital role Data Cleaning plays in conjunction with EDA. As I identified errors through EDA, I needed to revisit the data cleaning step to correct the cells and adjust my thinking. This process occurred frequently.
4) I have exported a clean and well-understood CSV file which can be efficiently used for future Machine Learning tasks.

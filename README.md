This repo contains data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using Jupyter Notebook and Python.

This is my first ever project including some major data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). I found the data set from an online Udemy course. The initial purpose of this data set was to be an instructor's assistant for discussing about the data types. In addition, the instructor used excel during the discussion. Therefore, what is presenting at this project consists of my genuine thoughts for almost 100%.

The project includes 3 files:
1) The main jupyter file.
2) The original and untouched excel data file. 
3) The exported excel data file after performing the data cleaning.
Number 3 data file is ideal for potential future use. It could be used for machine learning techniques application or further EDA.

What I gained from this project?
1) Opportunity to showcase some skills and a genuine way of personal thinking about a data set.
2) Consolidated why EDA is so useful. To be more specific, there wasn't additional context about the data set. I started almost from zero. I did some important mistakes during the process. EDA assisted me to see some patterns which could not be random, could not be correct, meaning that I had understood the columns context in a wrong way. For example, "Age at time of purchase" is not about buyer's age but only for building's age. EDA revealed it.
3) Consolidated why Data Cleaning in conjunction with EDA play a major role in data analysis. Finding my mistakes with EDA, I needed to turn back to data cleaning to rechange my cells and my way of thinking and this process happened a lot of times.
4) I exported a clean and known CSV file which can be effectively and quickly be used for ML techniques in the future.

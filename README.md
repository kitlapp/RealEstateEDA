# Real Estate Transactions Exploratory Data Analysis
This repository contains Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on real estate transaction data using Jupyter Notebook. This project offers an opportunity to showcase my approach to understanding the dataset, as there was no data documentation available. I had to derive all insights solely through the EDA process.

NOTE: I greatly acknowledge the Udemy course 'The Data Science Course: Complete Data Science Bootcamp 2024' (URL: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/?couponCode=ST21MT121624) for sharing the dataset. If there are any restrictions regarding sharing this dataset through my GitHub, please contact me via Udemy at userID 'Kimon Ioannis Lappas' and I will immediately delete both the original and cleaned datasets.

The initial intent of the course instructor was to use this dataset as a teaching tool for discussing data types. Therefore, the idea for this project, including the EDA process, is entirely my own.

## FILES INCLUDED:
1. Data Files, the original one (.xlsx) and the cleaned one (.csv) X 2
2. The core file, named 'main' (.ipynb) X 1
   <br>-->  I clear the cell outputs in Jupyter to maintain a clean code appearance. Please follow the instructions below to see how my code is executed and also view the generated .png files.
4. Visualizations X 6 (.png)
5. The README File

--> 10 Files in Total <--

## HOW TO SET UP THE ENVIRONMENT:
1. Download the project as a zip file or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Anaconda Prompt and type:
   <br>--> conda create --name 'YourEnvName' -c conda-forge jupyter=1.0.0 pandas=2.2.1 numpy=1.26.4 matplotlib=3.8.4 seaborn=0.12.2
3. Activate the newly-created environment.
4. Launch Jupyter via Anaconda Prompt.
5. Open the project's Jupyter named 'main'.
6. Enjoy!
